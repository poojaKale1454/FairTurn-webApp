FairTurn: The Fair Task Rotation Tracker
An intelligent and fun web application to manage household chores fairly and efficiently.
üöÄ Overview
FairTurn is designed to solve a common household problem: a fair division of labor. Instead of a fixed schedule, FairTurn uses a dynamic rotation system to ensure that every person gets a turn at each task. With a vibrant and user-friendly interface, it makes chore management transparent and hassle-free.

‚ú® Features
Fair Rotation: Automatically assigns tasks to the next person in the queue. The system ensures that all available tasks are distributed among people before the rotation starts again, promoting true fairness.

Persistent Data: All people, tasks, and history are saved directly in your browser's local storage. Your data persists even after you close the tab, so you don't have to re-enter everything.

Custom Frequencies: Beyond simple "daily" or "weekly" tasks, you can define tasks that occur every X number of days, offering complete flexibility for all your chores.

"Skip a Person" Function: Going on vacation? Feeling sick? You can temporarily remove someone from the rotation for the day with a single click. They'll automatically be re-added to the rotation for the next cycle.

Task History: Tracks and displays the last 10 completed tasks, so you can always see who did what and when.

Vibrant & Fun UI: A lively, colorful, and intuitive user interface makes managing chores a more pleasant experience.
